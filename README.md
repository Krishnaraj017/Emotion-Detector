# Emotion-Detector ðŸ™‚
This project is an implementation of Emotion Detection using Keras, AI, and Python. 
It uses a deep neural network (DNN) to analyze facial expressions and detect the emotion being displayed. 
The DNN is trained on a dataset of images labeled with the four basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised.
