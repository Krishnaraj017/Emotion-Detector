# Emotion-Detector ðŸ™‚
This project is an implementation of Emotion Detection using Keras, AI, and Python. 
It uses a deep neural network (DNN) to analyze facial expressions and detect the emotion being displayed. 
The DNN is trained on a dataset of images labeled with the four basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised.

DatasetðŸ“—
The DNN is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which is a set of 35,887 grayscale images of size 48x48 pixels. 
The dataset is divided into three sets: a training set of 28,709 images, a public test set of 3,589 images, and a private test set of 3,589 images.
